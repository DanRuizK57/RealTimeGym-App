## Introduction
As of today, people want to improve their physical condition, but many of them don't know where to start. As a solution to this problem, a mobile exercise app will be developed, with the unique feature of real-time workouts. This provides users with guidance for performing exercises and even creating custom routines based on their goals. In this stage of the project, we will provide the user interface aspects and its elements: the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.
